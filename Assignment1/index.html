    <div class="answer">
    <p class="Q first">Q1: Upon first interaction with the experience, the primary focus was the aesthetic design of the webpage, notably its
    colour scheme, font selection, and typography. The checkerboard motif particularly captured immediate attention.</p>
    <p class="Q second">Q2: - Engaged with a dialogue box and checkerboard portrait but received no response.<br>
    - Scrolled down to trigger an animation of a people cleaning the rubbish.<br>
    - Continued scrolling and interacting with animations while reading accompanying texts.<br>
    - Navigated through the gallery by vertical and horizontal swipes.<br>
    - Observed the depiction of janitors' current status through text and flying paper animation.<br>
    - Noted additional animations triggered by scrolling, including a figure discarding cigarette butts.<br>
    - Scrolled down, the collected garbage began to fly everywhere randomly.<br>
    - Encountered an animation of heart giving, advocating for respect towards janitors and providing recommendations for
    improved treatment.<br>
    - Interacted with thematic icons (Instagram & Message), leading to separate external social media and contact pages.</p>
    <p class="Q first">Q3: Most of the time was spent absorbing the textual content and observing the accompanying animations, which provided a
    deeper understanding of the janitorial profession.</p>
    <p class="Q second">Q4: Throughout the interaction, there was a consistent search for icons that would initiate new animations, ensuring that no
    aspect of the experience was overlooked.</p>
    <p class="Q first">Q5: The experience aims to enhance awareness and appreciation for the janitorial profession by showcasing their historical
    significance and varied roles. The website educates its visitors on the crucial contributions of janitors to public
    health and daily life, fostering a culture of respect and acknowledgment.</p>
    <p class="Q second">Q6: The website communicates its primary goal through an educational and engaging layout that includes historical
    information, personal stories, and multimedia elements related to janitors' roles. By showcasing detailed articles,
    impactful imagery, and perhaps interactive animations, it informs visitors about janitorial contributions and encourages
    respect for the profession.</p>
    <p class="Q first">Q7: In my opinion, this site is designed for immediate educational impact and long-term visitor engagement. It may support
    ongoing learning and interaction by updating janitor practices, continually adding historical content, highlighting
    current issues affecting janitors, and adding features that provide feedback on changes in janitor perceptions as
    visitors learn through the site, making it conducive to regular visits by students, educators, and people interested in
    social and labor issues.
</p>
    <p class="Q second">Q8: Interactive experiences may communicate the need for repeated interactions through features such as updated subscription
    options, community engagement tools such as forums or social media links, and blogs or news sections that provide
    ongoing content. These elements will show users that there are always new insights to discover, encouraging them to
    revisit and keep an ongoing interest in the community.
</p>

    <div id="box1">
        <p>Q9: The experience evokes the feeling of reading a detailed book about janitors, covering their history, responsibilities,
        and societal impacts. This narrative approach is complemented by an educational format reminiscent of a social
        humanities lecture, effectively using storytelling and animation to guide the user through a structured learning
        journey.
</p>
    </div>
    <div id="box2">
        <p> Q10: The website employs storytelling, animation and a monochromatic colour palette to emphasise the overlooked aspects of
        janitorial work, subtly guiding users to engage deeply with the content. This design approach encourages a thorough
        exploration and reflection, akin to reading an in-depth analysis.

    <div id="box3">
        <p>Q11:This website made me realize that we need to clearly position the field or purpose of the website application, and
        understand the habits, interests and needs of the target user group according to the accurate positioning. Then, use
        these clues to come up with scenarios and content that will make the user feel familiar and excited.

 </p>
    </div>
    <div id="box4">
        <p>Q12:The primary frustration of this experience comes from the excessively slow loading speed of the website opening, and the
        fact that the necessity and uniqueness of using mouse scrolling to navigate, which can destroy the visitor's sense of
        engagement and make the interaction less seamless and potentially diminish the user's focus and satisfaction.

</p>
    </div>

    <div id="box5">
        <p>Q13:The most satisfying aspects of the interaction are the dynamic animations, thoughtful color schemes and the tactile feel
        of the web page's design. These elements enrich the visual and intellectual experience, sparking curiosity and enhancing
        content comprehension.
