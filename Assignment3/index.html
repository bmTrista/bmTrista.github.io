    Description:
    To complement the bright colors and childlike style of the artworks chosen for the two themes, I created the main title of the webpage by hand. 
    This personalized touch enhances the visual appeal and thematic consistency of the site. 
    Therefore, I have directly incorporated the image as the title to maintain this cohesive aesthetic.

Description:
This is the interactive content block of the web page, featuring three main content areas. 
Each area is represented by a div with the class image-stack, which is a dynamic container displaying a collection of images. 
These image stacks are designed to draw attention to specific products or collections and make it easier for users to explore more details through clickable links.

The main image links to the "Vogue Magazine Archival Covers" product page.
When the mouse hovers over the main image, an overlay appears displaying the text "VOGUE MAGAZINE ARCHIVAL COVERS." along with a smaller text prompt "MORE>>>" that directs users to more information.
When users click "MORE", the page will be redirected to the NGV's official website, where they can find detailed information about these works and purchase options. 
This functionality helps NGV gather insights about user interest and purchasing behaviour, enabling them to develop more effective marketing strategies.

Each image stack also includes multiple stacked images, creating a layered visual effect that enhances the aesthetics and engagement of the web page. 
The hover effect on the main images ensures users are visually guided to click through for more information. 
This design not only improves user experience but also aids in effective data collection and user behavior analysis for better targeted marketing campaigns.
